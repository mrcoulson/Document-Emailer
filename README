Works fine if web server runs SMTP.
Now to figure out how to specify SMTP authentication for remote SMTP.

Added confirmation of email sending today.  Next: "confirm email" field.

Added email confirmation field. Also added check to make sure the document has not been requested

Incidentally, the HTML validates as HTML5.
